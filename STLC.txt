Requirement phase

User story

* Creating post

I want to be able to create a blog post, I would hope that the program never crashes. Creating a post should be user friendly and it should always be clear in which step of the process I am in creating a post.

* Listing all posts

I want to be able to see all the old and new posts created in a list.

* Searching for post

I want to be able to search for specific posts and only read them, as opposed to showing all the posts in the previous story.

* The posts should be saved to file

I want to save the posts to a file locally and they should be stored in json format.
